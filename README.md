(so not just on an off, they can have a fixed chain of colours, and off).

## About

Play or Solve the puzzle game LightsOut

The aim of this repository is to enable anyone to play with 
the logic behind the game LightsOut.

You could learn a new computer language by porting from another one.

You can learn about bitwise operators.

You can write a program that can write a better version.

http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/ and https://rosettacode.org/ are sites that Alexx thinks are wonderful.
This repository is meant to be a little like that, but for LightsOut. Rather than
golfing the code, we are building a better golf-cart: A buggy without bugs?

Links to examples, (both good and bad). How to play and solve as much as how not to.
